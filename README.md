# Running the code

To start the simulation, run main.m file using MATLAB. Parameters can be found at the top of the main.m file. This code was tested using MATLAB R2011b.

# Video

This short video illustrates anti-flocking and obstacle avoidance functions of 5 agents. More details can be found in the above paper.
